      An atomic force microscope measures properties such as height, friction <br>and magnetism of small samples such as atoms.
      The microscope uses a <br>probe to go over the surface and measure the force between it and the sam-<br>ple. The data collected is then used
      to determine the properties of the <br>sample.

   As the cantilever oscillates across the sample, the force between the probe <br>and the surface is measured and translated to the graph below. In this specific<br> graph, the
   heights of the sample are recorded which allows us to determine the <br>shape of the sample.
