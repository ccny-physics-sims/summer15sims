    <p> The STM is an instrument for imaging surfaces at the atomic level.
    It uses a conducting tip that is brought very close to the surface to
    be examined. A voltage difference applied between the two can allow
    electrons to "tunnel" the vacuum between them, generating a current. </p>

    <p> This graph demonstrates that when a conducting tip goes over the surface of an object, depending on how close the tip is near an atom, the current generated will vary.
    If the current is stronger, then it can be assumed that the atom is closer to the tip, and if the current generated is weaker it can be assumed that atom is farther. The differences in the current helps map out the surfaces of the atoms.The above picture shows how the STM can be used to manipulate atoms and create stunning images. </p>
